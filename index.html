        <p>
          We are a board game café opening soon on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis.
          We will offer an accomodating space to play board games with friends and strangers
          coupled with access to an extensive library of board games, all while serving
          a light menu of food and drinks. We are part café/bar and part creative-gaming space.

        <h2>Why Revolution?</h2>
        <p>
          Revolutions are movements of the people towards change. We feel that in
          our constantly changing culture and world, positive change needs to be
          made by communal efforts. Alleviating poverty, spreading joy, and
          reconciling racial tension are just a few of our personal goals and we
          wanted our brand to reflect our values, no matter how big or lofty. As well,
          we wanted to curate a space that harkened to the colonial times where
          early Americans conspired about the revolution in a warm tavern. We hold
          this historic period dearly in our hearts as it was our country’s founding, a
          time of unbounded possibility.

        <h2>Why the Delmar Loop?</h2>
        <p>
          We have lived on the Loop for the past 4 years and have grown to love
          the milieu of culture and commerce. The Loop is at the intersection of the
          city and the county, college students and natives, artists and business
          people, and white and black. It is a paradoxical place of blooming
          creativity and heartbreaking segregation, a geographical focal point of all
          the city's best and all the city's worst. While our mission is simple we
          realize we live in a complicated world and a complicated space. This is
          just one of our ways to reconcile differences and create community, and
          we feel there is no better place than where we are at now.

        <h2>Why board games?</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout college, we have seen board games change people. The
          stolid become goofy, the nonchalant become competitive, and the
          innocent become mischievous. Board games provide universal,
          face-to-face entertainment in a rapidly changing digital age. But, we don’t
          aim to fight the change of our digital age with traditional entertainment or
          outdated games, and we don’t have to. Board games are both nostalgic
          and fresh. We grew up playing board games with our families and we
          know many people have done the same. The classics like Monopoly and
          Chess hold a dear part of our childhoods and were some of the best times
          around the family dinner table. But, board games aren’t all nostalgia and
          sentimentality, a new wave of games has seized a new audience with
          reports of an increasing market size and industry growth. For example,
          the game Exploding Kittens raised $8.78 million on Kickstarter in January
          2015. Board games are going through a golden age. Game developers
          from the big publishing houses of Hasbro to the growing indy community
          found on Kickstarter have been revolutionizing the gaming industry and
          reaching new and growing markets, sometimes even straddling the line of
          digital gaming. Quite simply, they have innovated an age old experience.
          We seek to continue this trend with board game cafés.
